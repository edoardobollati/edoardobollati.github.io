          <p style="text-align: justify;">Hello! My name is Edoardo Bollati and I'm a 4th year Economics Ph.D. Candidate at <a href="https://economics.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>.</p>
          <p>My main research interests are in the political economy, media economics, and development economics.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to moving to Cornell, I worked as a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/Research/Departments/DE/">Stockholm School of Economics</a> and at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sef/">Queen Mary University of London</a>. I also worked at the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/dac/">Development and Cooperation Directorate of the OECD</a>.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">I hold a M.Sc. in Economics (with Distinction) from the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/">University of Warwick</a>.</p>

			  <h3 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">High-Speed Broadband Internet and the Rise of Populism: Evidence from Italian Elections</h3>
			  <p style="text-align: justify;">In this paper I study whether exposure to high-speed broadband Internet explains the increasing electoral success of populist parties. Thanks to novel data on high-speed broadband coverage and on the completion dates of a government intervention that expanded exposure to high-speed broadband across Italy, in a difference-in-differences design I assess the impact of being exposed to high-speed broadband prior to elections on the vote share of populist parties, their political non-populist competition and on turnout both at Parliamentary and European elections. I show that municipalities that were exposed to high-speed broadband before the 2018 Parliamentary elections experienced a 2.9 percentage point (6%) increase in support for populist parties relative to municipalities that remained uncovered until after elections. This rise is primarily attributed to parties like the 5 Star Movement and Forza Italia, known for their effective use of online platforms for political campaigning.The decline in support for  leftist non-populist parties, and the null effects on turnout suggest that the channel through which high-speed broadband plays a role is vote switching, rather than connection to a disenchanted electorate. I also show that the effects are less pronounced in European elections, hinting at a "marginal voters mechanism" where high-speed broadband disproportionately influences undecided voters that search online for last minute pieces of information close to election day, leading to a greater persuasion effect at more salient elections.</p>
